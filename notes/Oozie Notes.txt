Oozie workflow actions start jobs in remote systems (i.e. Hadoop, Pig). 
Upon action completion, the remote systems callback Oozie to notify the action completion, at this point Oozie proceeds to the next action in the workflow.

Oozie workflows contain control flow nodes and action nodes.

Control flow nodes define the beginning and the end of a workflow ( start , end and fail nodes) and provide a mechanism to control the workflow execution path ( decision , fork and join nodes).
    start
    end
    kill
    decision
    fork
    join


Action nodes are the mechanism by which a workflow triggers the execution of a computation/processing task. 
Oozie provides support for different types of actions as mentioned below and can be extended to support additional type of actions as well.
    Hadoop map-reduce
    Hadoop file system
    Pig
    SSH
    HTTP
    eMail
    Oozie sub-workflow

Oozie workflows can be parameterized (using variables like ${inputDir} within the workflow definition).
When submitting a workflow job values for the parameters must be provided.
If properly parameterized (i.e. using different output directories) several identical workflow jobs can concurrently.

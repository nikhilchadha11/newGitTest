2. Function Overloading

3. Spark SQL -> Can I create External Tables -> Can I Map a table to a specified path -> External Tables are possible

4. Create Schema from header of the Text File automatically -> Data Brick Spark -> Infer Schema -> CSV API

5. ORC File Read -> using Hive Context

8. Same as Counters in Hadoop

9. Can the same SourceVertex and DestVertex have more than 1 Relationships? -> USe List in Edges instead of String

10. How do we Persist a Graph?

11. Can we use a GraphDB like Neo4J? -> There are Direct APIs

12. These are Directed Graphs. How do we Figure Out if the Graph is Cyclic or ACyclic?
